# Working Directory

The TC is newly formed and there is not yet consensus on 
what the work products will be. 
While we are figuring stuff out, 
we need a place to stick contributions 
and potential work products. 
So until we know what directories to form for each work product, 
this "working" directory is a place to stick stuff.

It contains:
- [JADN Information Model Examples](JADN%20examples)
- [Teapot](./Teapot/)
   + a directory with a image of a particular example teapot software and relationships.
   + hopefully will eventually have source for image
- add stuff here as it comes in
