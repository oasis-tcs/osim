## **Q: How does OSIM define "supply chain"?**
**A:** 
In the context of OSIM, a supply chain is the network of all the individuals, organizations, resources, activities and technology involved in the creation, sale and delivery of an artifact to the end user.
The supply chain may involve both physical and virtual [artifacts](./artifact.md). 
In the case of physical artifacts, the supply chain begins with raw materials and ends with the "finished product" artifact delivered to end users.
In the case of virtual artifacts, the supply chain is the combination of people, processes, systems, software, and data that are involved in the development, deployment, and maintenance of the artifact.
